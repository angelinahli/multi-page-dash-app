# Multi Page Dash App Template

*Note: This organization template is outdated. The easier way to create a multi page Dash app seems to be to create an HTML base and override Dash's in-built template. See [this app](https://github.com/angelinahli/bachelorette) for a more recent implementation.*

This repository serves as a template for a multi-page Dash app built on top of a Flask-inspired, Bootstrappy base template. Thanks to this helpful [tutorial](https://dash.plot.ly/urls).

## Run Instructions
1. Download / Clone repo
